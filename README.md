# Music_Quiz

## Project Description
This is a full stack website using a django backend and a React frontend. The website is a game that takes you through different music genres and quizes you on some of the top songs from each genre. After you create an account and log in you have the option to view your highscores as well as add, edit, or delete any songs that you listen to that you want to be quizzed on.
